            "input_text": """The most evident benefit from the use of cloud computing systems and technologies is the
increased economical return due to the reduced maintenance costs and operational costs related to IT software and infrastructure. This is mainly because IT assets, namely software and infrastructure, are turned into utility costs, which are paid for as long as they are used, not paid for up front. Capital costs are costs associated with assets that need to be paid in advance to start a business activity. Before cloud computing, IT infrastructure and software generated capital costs, since they were paid up front so that business start-ups could afford a computing infrastructure, enabling the business activities of the organization. The revenue of the business is then utilized to compensate over time for these costs. Organizations always minimize capital costs, since they are often associated with depreciable values. This is the case of hardware: a server bought today for $1,000 will have a market value less than its original price when it is eventually replaced by new hardware. To make profit, organizations have to compensate for this depreciation created by time, thus reducing the net gain obtained from revenue. Minimizing capital costs, then, is fundamental. Cloud computing transforms IT infrastructure and software into utilities, thus significantly contributing to increasing a companyâ€™s net gain. Moreover, cloud computing also provides an opportunity for small organizations and start-ups: these do not need large investments to start their business, but they can comfortably grow with it. Finally, maintenance costs are significantly reduced: by renting the Cloud computing at a glance. infrastructure and the application services, organizations are no longer responsible for their maintenance. This task is the responsibility of the cloud service provider, who, thanks to economies of scale, can bear the maintenance costs. Increased agility in defining and structuring software systems is another significant benefit of cloud computing. Since organizations rent IT services, they can more dynamically and flexibly compose their software systems, without being constrained by capital costs for IT assets. There is a reduced need for capacity planning, since cloud computing allows organizations to react to unplanned surges in demand quite rapidly. For example, organizations can add more servers to process workload spikes and dismiss them when they are no longer needed. Ease of scalability is another advantage. By leveraging the potentially huge capacity of cloud computing, organizations can extend their IT capability more easily. Scalability can be leveraged across the entire computing stack. Infrastructure providers offer simple methods to provision customized hardware and integrate it into existing systems. Platform-as-a-Service providers offer runtime environment and programming models that are designed to scale applications. Software-as-a-Service offerings can be elastically sized on demand without requiring users to provision hardware or to program application for scalability. End users can benefit from cloud computing by having their data and the capability of operating on it always available, from anywhere, at any time, and through multiple devices. Information and services stored in the cloud are exposed to users by Web-based interfaces that make them accessible from portable devices as well as desktops at home. Since the processing capabilities (that is, office automation features, photo editing, information management, and so on) also reside in the cloud, end users can perform the same tasks that previously were carried out through considerable software investments. The cost for such opportunities is generally very limited, since the cloud service provider shares its costs across all the tenants that he is servicing. Multitenancy allows for better utilization of the shared infrastructure that is kept operational and fully active. The
concentration of IT infrastructure and services into large datacenters also provides opportunity for considerable optimization in terms of resource allocation and energy efficiency, which eventually can lead to a less impacting approach on the environment. Finally, service orientation and on-demand access create new opportunities for composing systems and applications with a flexibility not possible before cloud computing. New service offerings can be created by aggregating together existing services and concentrating on added value. Since it is possible to provision on demand any component of the computing stack, it is easier to turn ideas into products with limited costs and by concentrating technical efforts on what matters: the added value."""
